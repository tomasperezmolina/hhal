  by Marco Tarini

  A simple class to define simple looped animations
  and save them as gif.

  Usage:
  Just include this file in your code and use the class.

public:

    // Constructor. Use a new instance for each new animation you want to save.
    // All the frames will be sized [sx]X[sy]
    AnimatedGifSaver(int sx, int sy);

    // Descrutcor
    ~AnimatedGifSaver();

    // Adds a frame that is to last [dt] seconds
    // "data" is the image (r,g,b,r,g,b,r,g,b...), bottom-to-top
    // The first frame defines the palette
    bool AddFrame(Byte* data,  float dt);

    // Saves the results in a gif file
    bool Save(const char* filename);
